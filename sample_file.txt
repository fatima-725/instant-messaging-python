In this example, if x is less than 0,
the first condition is True and the corresponding block of
 code will be executed. If x is not less than 0, the first condition
 is False, so the program moves on to the next condition, x == 0.
 If x is equal to 0, the second condition is True and its corresponding
 block of code will be executed. If neither the first nor the second condition i
 s True, the program will execute the code block associated with the "else" statement.

The "elif" statement allows you to chain multiple conditions together and handle different
 cases based on the evaluated conditions.
